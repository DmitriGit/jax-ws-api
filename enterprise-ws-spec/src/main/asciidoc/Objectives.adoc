== Objectives

This section lists the high level objectives of this specification.

* Build on the evolving industry standards for Web services,
specifically WSDL 1.1, SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2.
* Leverage existing Java EE technology.
* Ensure that programmers may implement and package Web services that
properly deploy onto application servers that comply with Java EE and
this specification.
* Ensure that vendor implementations of this specification
inter-operate, i.e. a Web service client on one vendorâ€™s implementation
must be able to interact with Web services executing on another vendors
implementation.
* Define the minimal set of new concepts, interfaces, file formats, etc.
necessary to support Web services within Java EE.
* Clearly and succinctly define functions that Java EE application
server vendors need to provide.
* Define the roles that this specification requires, the functions they
perform and their mapping to Java EE platform roles. Define the
functions that a Web Services for Java EE product provider must provide
to support these roles.
* Support a simple model for defining a new Web service and deploying
this into a Java EE application server.

=== Client Model Goals

The client programming model should be conformant and compatible with
the client programming model defined by JAX-RPC or JAX-WS.

Additional goals for the client programming model are to ensure that:

* Programmers can implement Web services client applications conforming
to this specification that may reside in a Java EE container (e.g. an
EJB that uses a Web service), or a Java EE Client Container can call a
Web service running in a Web Services for Java EE container.
* Client applications conforming to this specification can call any SOAP
1.1 or SOAP 1.2 based Web service through the HTTP 1.1 or HTTPS SOAP
Bindings.
* Programmers using other client environments such as Java 2 Standard
Edition environment can call a Web service running in a Web Services for
Java EE container. Programmers using languages other than Java must be
able to implement SOAP 1.1 or SOAP 1.2 compliant applications that can
use Web services conforming to this specification. Support the Client
Development Scenarios described in Chapter 4.
* Client developers must not have to be aware of how the service
implementation is realized.
* Java 2 Micro Edition clients, defined by JSR 172, should be able to
interoperate using the transport standards declared within WSDL and the
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS runtime with Web Services for Java EE applications.

=== Service Development Goals

The service development model defines how web service implementations
are to be developed and deployed into existing Java EE containers and
includes the following specific goals:

* How the Web service has been implemented should be transparent to the
Web service client. A client should not have to know if the Web service
has been deployed in a Java EE or non-Java EE environment.
* Because the Web service implementation must be deployed in a Java EE
container, the class implementing the service must conform to some
defined requirements to ensure that it does not compromise the integrity
of the application server.
* JAX-RPC defines three server side run time categories, J2SE based
JAX-RPC Runtime, Servlet Container Based JAX-RPC Runtime, and Java EE
Container Based JAX-RPC Runtime. This specification defines the Java EE
container based (Web and EJB) runtime such that it is consistent with
the Servlet Container based model defined by the JAX-RPC specification.
* This specification is amended to define the Java EE container based
(Web and EJB) runtime such that it is consistent with the programming
model defined by the JAX-WS specification.
* Support mapping and dispatching SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 requests to methods on
Java EE Stateless or Singleton(only JAX-WS) Session Beans.
* Support mapping and dispatching SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 requests to methods on
JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint classes in the Web Container.

=== Service Deployment Goals

* Web service deployment is declarative. We do this through extending
the Java EE model for deployment descriptors and EAR file format. These
changes are minimized, however.
* Web service deployment is supported on Java EE environments.
* Deployment requires that a service be representable by WSDL.
Deployment requires a WSDL file. The deployment of Web services must
support:

* those who wish to deploy a Web service as the focus of the deployment
* those who wish to expose existing, deployed Java EE components as a
Web service

=== Service Publication Goals

* Service deployment may publish the WSDL to the appropriate service
registry, repository (if required by the Web service), File, or URL.
* If a Web service needs to be published by the deployment tools, all of
the data required to perform the publication must be provided in the
deployment package or during the deployment process.
* If any publication to UDDI is performed, the WSDL must also be made
available at a URL.

=== Web Services Registry Goals

The Web services registry API and programming model is out of the scope
of this specification. The Web service implementation, Web service
client, or Web service deployment tool may use any registry API
including JAX-R. JAX-R does not support WSDL publication directly. It
does support interaction with UDDI directories. UDDI.org specifies how
to publish a WSDL described service to a UDDI directory.

This specification defines the service publication responsibilities of
the deployment tool.

Service definition discovery (finding the WSDL to be implemented) during
development or deployment of a service implementation is not defined.

Service discovery during development, deployment, or runtime of service
clients is not defined.
