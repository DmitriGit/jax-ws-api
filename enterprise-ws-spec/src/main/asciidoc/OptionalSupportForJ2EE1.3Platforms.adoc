== Optional support for J2EE 1.3 platforms

Web Services for J2EE Version 1.1 does not require support for
applications built according to the Web Services for J2EE Version 1.0
specification. A vendor may optionally support Web Services for J2EE 1.0
by implementing that version of the specification. See the Web Services
Version 1.0 Change Log for more details on the differences between the
two specifications.
